# TimeMachineProject
A theoretical and simulation-based research project on artificial gravity and time dilation for time travel.
# Time Machine Project

This project explores the possibility of time dilation and artificial gravity through electromagnetic fields, based on the principles of General Relativity and Electromagnetism.

## Goals
- Theoretical modeling of artificial gravitational fields
- Simulation of time dilation effects under electromagnetic influence
- Explore mechanisms for safe, controlled time manipulation

## Contents
- Research paper (PDF)
- Simulation source code (Python/MATLAB)
- Diagrams and results
- Public discussion and updates
